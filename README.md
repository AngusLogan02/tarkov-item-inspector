# tarkov-item-inspector
A tool to automatically identify and examine un-examined items from Escape from Tarkov trader inventories. This is a chore at the beginning of wipe and when new trader levels are unlocked, this tool aims to provide a small QoL upgrade.
## Goals
- Use machine learning to identify un-examined items
- Inspect these items by moving the mouse and clicking on the items in game

## Nice-to-haves
- Would like to include a GUI, however I don't deem it necessary.
